                <p>Hello and welcome to Tech Career Insights, the podcast where we explore the fascinating journeys of software professionals who are shaping our digital world. I'm your host, Alex Rivera, and today I have a really interesting conversation lined up for you.</p>
                <p>My guest today is Christo Lotriet, a software developer with an impressive two decades of experience spanning multiple continents and industries. From processing millions of telecommunications records in South Africa to securing government records in North Carolina, Christo's journey is a masterclass in adaptability and technical excellence.</p>
                <p>Christo, welcome to the show!</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Thank you, Alex! It's great to be here. I'm really excited to share my journey with your listeners.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>So, let's start at the beginning. You earned your Computer Science degree from the University of South Africa in 2008. What drew you to software development initially?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>You know, I've always enjoyed problem-solving. During my studies, I learned programming fundamentals and database concepts, but honestly, it was my first job that really opened my eyes. Working on systems that processed real business data - I started to see how software actually helps people do their work. That's what kept me interested in this field.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>And that impact certainly shows in your career trajectory. Your first major role was with LGR Telecommunications in Pretoria. Tell us about that experience.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>That was an incredible learning experience. I worked there from 2006 to 2011, and we were developing CDR systems - that's Call Detail Record processing systems - that handled millions of telecommunications records daily for major carriers. We're talking about massive scale, real-time data processing, fraud detection systems, billing analysis...</p>
                <p>The technical challenges were enormous, but what really shaped me was learning to build systems that absolutely cannot fail. When you're processing millions of records for major telecom carriers, downtime isn't an option.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>High-stakes development right from the start! And I notice you worked extensively with databases even back then. That seems to be a consistent thread throughout your career.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Absolutely. I've worked across SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL throughout my career. At LGR, I really dove deep into performance optimization, understanding how to design databases that could handle enormous transaction volumes while still delivering fast query responses. Those foundational skills have served me incredibly well in every role since.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>After telecommunications, you moved into healthcare with Healthrad. That's quite a shift. What was that transition like?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>It was fascinating because while the industry changed dramatically, the core challenges remained similar - building reliable, secure systems that handle sensitive data at scale. At Healthrad, I worked on a comprehensive Radiology Information System used by multiple radiology practices.</p>
                <p>The interesting part was the human element. We integrated speech recognition technology to improve radiologist workflow efficiency. Watching doctors interact with the system, seeing how the software directly impacted their ability to provide better patient care - that was incredibly rewarding.</p>
                <p>And of course, healthcare data has its own unique security and compliance requirements. It really expanded my understanding of building responsible, compliant software systems.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Security and compliance - those are critical skills in today's environment. Now, I see you also spent time at Wagersoft working on a sports betting platform. Talk about different industries!</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Yes, that was definitely different! But you know what? The technical challenges were just as demanding, if not more so. We maintained a high-availability platform that had to stay absolutely stable during major sporting events - think World Cup finals, championship games.</p>
                <p>The system had to handle high concurrent user loads, real-time reporting, database replication strategies... During peak events, downtime wasn't an option. The platform had to be up and responsive no matter what.</p>
                <p>It taught me a lot about system architecture, load balancing, and building resilient applications under pressure.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>I love how each role seems to have added another layer to your expertise. You also worked at NOSA on occupational health and safety systems.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>That's right. From 2015 to 2017, I developed a risk management system that featured QlikView dashboards and real-time compliance monitoring tools. This was all about workplace safety - helping organizations monitor and improve their occupational health and safety metrics.</p>
                <p>What I enjoyed about that role was the combination of complex data visualization and the social impact. When your software helps prevent workplace injuries and ensures compliance with safety regulations, you're genuinely making workplaces safer.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>And then you also worked at Med-e-Mass on practice management systems. That seems like a natural fit with your healthcare and database expertise.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Yes, from 2017 to 2020, I developed full-stack practice management systems used by medical professionals across South Africa. This was particularly interesting because I was working with PostgreSQL extensively, building systems for medical practices to manage their operations - patient records, billing, scheduling, all integrated into cohesive platforms with responsive user interfaces.</p>
                <p>I got deep into PostgreSQL optimization - stored procedures, indexing strategies, query optimization. And the healthcare data compliance requirements kept me sharp on security best practices.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>After that, I joined Discovery Limited - one of South Africa's largest medical insurance and healthcare companies. From 2020 to 2022, I worked on their enterprise healthcare systems, which was a great opportunity to work at scale with modern CI/CD practices using Jenkins and Agile methodologies.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>So all of this amazing experience was in South Africa, but I understand you made a significant move in 2023. Tell us about that.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Yes, in 2023 I relocated to the United States, specifically to North Carolina. It was a big life change, but also an exciting professional opportunity. I joined Courthouse Computer Systems as a Web Developer.</p>

                <p>And what does that role entail?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>We developed and maintained web-based public records systems that support Register of Deeds offices across multiple North Carolina counties. These are the systems that provide public access to land records, vital records, all those critical government documents.</p>
                <p>I worked primarily with the Microsoft technology stack and MySQL - enhancing these systems to improve usability and reliability. This includes developing features like secure online payment processing for certified document requests and ensuring consistent access for county staff and the public.</p>
                <p>It's government technology, which means it has to be rock-solid reliable, secure, and accessible. We're serving thousands of North Carolina residents who depend on these systems for property records, legal documents, and vital statistics.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>That's really impactful work. Now, looking at your technical skills, I notice you've made a significant transition over the years from Delphi to modern .NET technologies. How did you navigate that evolution?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>That's a great question. I actually worked with Delphi extensively earlier in my career - it was a powerful tool for building Windows applications back then. But I recognized that the industry was moving toward web-based solutions and modern frameworks.</p>
                <p>Since 2020, I've been actively working on the .NET stack, mainly C#, and I've really embraced the entire modern development ecosystem - Git for version control, JIRA for project management, working in Agile and Scrum environments.</p>
                <p>The key for me has always been staying curious and adaptable. Technology changes constantly, and if you're not learning, you're falling behind.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Speaking of staying current, I see you're actively learning Azure OpenAI and cloud technologies right now. That's cutting-edge stuff. What's driving that interest?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>I'm genuinely fascinated by what's happening with generative AI right now. I describe myself as an adaptable developer who leverages AI tools strategically, and I think that's the future of software development.</p>
                <p>I'm working through Microsoft's learning paths on Azure AI Services and Azure OpenAI Service integration, doing hands-on projects, really getting into prompt engineering and understanding how to integrate these capabilities into real applications.</p>
                <p>I think the developers who will thrive in the next decade are those who can effectively harness AI to augment their work, not replace it. I want to be at the forefront of that.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>That's a really progressive mindset. Some developers are intimidated by AI, but you're embracing it.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Exactly. I see AI as a powerful tool in the developer's toolkit, just like any other framework or library. The key is using it strategically while ensuring thorough validation and maintaining good architectural considerations.</p>
                <p>Human judgment, creativity, and problem-solving are still absolutely essential. AI can help us write boilerplate code faster, suggest solutions, catch errors... but the architectural decisions, the business logic, the user experience considerations - those still require experienced developers.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>So looking at your career now - you've worked in telecommunications, healthcare multiple times, sports betting, occupational safety, and now government technology. If you had to identify the common thread through all of these experiences, what would it be?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>I think it's solving complex problems with elegant, reliable solutions. Every industry has been different, but the core challenge has always been: how do we build systems that handle large-scale data, serve many users simultaneously, remain secure and compliant, and actually make people's work easier.</p>
                <p>Whether it's a radiologist dictating reports, a county clerk searching property records, or a telecom analyst detecting fraud - I'm building tools that real people use to do important work. That's what drives me.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>And looking forward, what kind of opportunities are you seeking? What's the ideal next chapter for Christo?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>I'm really open to several paths. I'm particularly interested in roles like Web Developer, Project Management Associate, Data Analyst, or Technical Coordinator - positions where I can apply my diverse technical background and collaborative approach to deliver measurable business value.</p>
                <p>What's important to me is working with teams that value continuous learning, that are tackling interesting technical challenges, and where I can contribute both my two decades of hands-on development experience and my forward-thinking approach to emerging technologies.</p>
                <p>I bring strong full-stack capabilities, deep database expertise, experience across multiple industries, and a proven track record of delivering mission-critical systems. Plus, I think my international perspective and adaptability - relocating to a new country, learning new technology stacks, embracing AI tools - shows that I can thrive in changing environments.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>You certainly bring a unique combination of depth and breadth. The international experience, the industry diversity, the technical evolution from legacy systems to cutting-edge cloud and AI... that's a really compelling profile.</p>
              </div>
