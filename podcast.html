                <p>Hello and welcome to Tech Career Insights, the podcast where we explore the fascinating journeys of professionals in technology. My guest today is Christo Lotriet, a software developer with an impressive two decades of experience spanning multiple continents and industries. Christo, welcome to the show!</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Thank you, Alex. It's great to be here!</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Let's start at the beginning. You started your career back in 2006 with LGR Telecommunications in South Africa. What was that experience like?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>That was an incredible learning experience. I was working on CDR systems‚ÄîCall Detail Record processing‚Äîhandling millions of telecommunications records daily for major South African carriers. We built reporting tools for billing analysis and fraud detection. The scale was massive, and it taught me early on about performance optimization and handling high-volume data processing.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>From telecom, you moved into healthcare with Healthrad. That's quite a shift. What drew you to that industry?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Healthcare technology fascinated me because of its direct impact on people's lives. At Healthrad, I developed a Radiology Information System used by practices across South Africa. We integrated speech recognition technology to improve radiologist workflows, created diagnostic report templates, and automated billing systems‚Äîall while ensuring strict compliance with healthcare regulations. It was challenging but incredibly rewarding.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Your next role was with Wagersoft in the sports betting industry. That must have required rock-solid reliability.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Absolutely. High-availability was non-negotiable. We're talking about a platform that needed 100% uptime during major sporting events. I worked on real-time reporting systems and implemented database replication strategies. The pressure during big events was intense, but it taught me a lot about building truly resilient systems.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Then you moved to NOSA for occupational health and safety. What kind of systems were you building there?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>At NOSA, I developed risk management systems with QlikView dashboards and real-time compliance monitoring. We optimized database designs specifically for reporting and analysis of workplace safety metrics. It was all about giving organizations the tools they needed to keep their people safe.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Med-e-Mass brought you back to healthcare. Tell us about that experience.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>That was a full-stack role developing a practice management system for medical professionals across South Africa. I designed REST API services for secure healthcare data workflows and created responsive user interfaces. A big focus was PostgreSQL optimization‚Äîstored procedures, indexing, performance tuning‚Äîall while maintaining compliant healthcare data handling.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Discovery Limited is a major name in South African healthcare. What was it like working there?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Discovery was my introduction to enterprise-scale healthcare systems. I supported Discovery Health through team-based development and maintenance work, worked extensively with SQL scripts and stored procedures, and got deep into multi-environment CI/CD processes using Jenkins. The daily Agile practices‚Äîstand-ups, peer testing‚Äîreally sharpened my collaborative skills.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>And that's also when you transitioned to .NET and C#, correct?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Yes! I'd been working primarily with Delphi for years, but in 2020 I made the shift to .NET technologies. It was a deliberate move to align with where the industry was heading. I embraced modern web development with ASP.NET MVC, C#, and cloud platforms.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Then in 2023, you made a major life change‚Äîrelocating to the United States to join Courthouse Computer Systems. How was that transition?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>It was significant both professionally and personally. At Courthouse Computer Systems, I work on web-based public records systems for Register of Deeds offices across North Carolina counties. We're talking about systems that provide reliable access to land and vital records, secure online payment processing for certified documents. It's government technology that needs to be bulletproof. The transition from South Africa to the US was challenging, but the work itself felt familiar‚Äîbuilding mission-critical systems that people depend on.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>You've worked with quite a range of databases‚ÄîSQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL. What's your approach to database architecture?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>Every database has its strengths. I've learned to optimize for the specific use case‚Äîwhether it's PostgreSQL's advanced features for complex queries, SQL Server's enterprise tooling, or MySQL's simplicity and speed. Database design and performance are often where projects succeed or fail, so I focus heavily on indexing strategies, query optimization, and understanding the actual data access patterns.</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Host:</span>
                <p>Let's talk about your current learning focus‚ÄîAzure OpenAI and cloud technologies. What's driving that interest?</p>
              </div>

              <div class="transcript-line">
                <span class="speaker">Christo:</span>
                <p>The AI revolution is here, and I want to be at the forefront. I'm actively developing expertise in Azure OpenAI Service, prompt engineering, and building generative AI pipelines through hands-on projects and Microsoft learning paths. I see AI as a powerful tool to augment development workflows, but it requires strategic use‚Äîyou need thorough validation, architectural considerations, and a clear understanding of what you're building.</p>
